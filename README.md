To improve my SQL proficiency and showcase my query language skills, I cleaned the "Nashville Housing Dataset."
### Dataset
The dataset was provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data). 
It is home value data for the hot Nashville market and it contains 56,000+ rows altogether. 
The SQL queries were run in Microsoft SQL Server 2022.

Clauses and Concepts applied include:
- CONVERT
- PARSENAME
- REPLACE
- DROP COLUMN
- SUBSTRING
- CHARONDEX
- CASE
- PARTITION BY
- CTE TABLE
