To enhance my SQL proficiency and demonstrate my query language skills, I undertook a project to clean the "Nashville Housing Dataset."

### Dataset
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data). 
It is home value data for the hot Nashville market and it contains 56,000+ rows altogether. 
I executed the SQL queries using the Microsoft SQL Server 2022.

Clauses and Concepts applied include:
- CONVERT
- PARSENAME
- REPLACE
- DROP COLUMN
- SUBSTRING
- CHARONDEX
- CASE
- PARTITION BY
- CTE TABLE

The project involved leveraging these SQL functionalities to cleanse and refine the dataset, ensuring its accuracy and usability for further analysis and insights. Through this project, I honed my SQL skills, particularly in data manipulation and transformation, and gained valuable experience in handling large datasets in a real-world context.
